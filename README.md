# My .dotfiles

This repository includes all of my custom dotfiles.

The setup script is smart enough to back up your existing dotfiles into a ~/dotfiles_old/ directory if you already have any dotfiles of the same name as the dotfile symlinks being created in your home directory.

## Installation

```bash
git clone git://github.com/enda/dotfiles.git
cd dotfiles
./install.sh
```
